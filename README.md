# What needs to be considered while making schedule decisions
- Grade
- Classes taken
- Uncompleted required credits
- Required classes for upcoming year
- List of chosen classes
    - Each class has back up choices
    - Is a class double blocked, regular, or semester?
    - How many slots are available for each class
    - When are those slots available

<br>

# OPTIONAL things that would be "nices to haves"
- if a student requests NOT to have a teacher (or to have a specific teacher)
- rigor of class (try not to pair a lot of intense classes on the same day)
